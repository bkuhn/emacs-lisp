# bkuhn's Emacs Lisp


I am slowly releasing all the Emacs Lisp that I've written since 1992 to the
public. This will be a long process, because I have a lot of generally useful
Emacs Lisp stuff intertwined in my .emacs file with more private
configuration stuff that cannot be made public because it contains personal
information (such as calendar data and the like).
